RedditActivityTracker
=====================

This bot will monitor the activity of a specific user and then personal message your account or send you a text message (depending on user preferences) when they comment or create a submission.

The final goal is to get the script running in the cloud because it currently executes continually. This is to avoid having the need for the script to be operating on the computer 24/7.
